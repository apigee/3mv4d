# Management API - Deploy Proxy Revision

Using the Edge management API to deploy a proxy revision is often used during API lifecycle management processes. This is a very straightforward process and is easy to integrate into your SDLC.

In the [video](https://youtu.be/3BEKp6DrmTo) we provide examples of deploying a proxy revision to an environment where no revision was previously deployed as well as deploying a new revision to an environment where a previous revision is deployed.

Documentation on the Edge Management API is available [online](http://apigee.com/docs/management/apis) including the specific documentation for [deploying an API proxy revision](http://apigee.com/docs/management/apis/post/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/environments/%7Benv_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/revisions/%7Brevision_number%7D/deployments).
